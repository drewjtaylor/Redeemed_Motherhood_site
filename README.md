# Redeemed Childbirth Website


## Goal
This repository has been set up as I learn to create a functioning website for "Redeemed Childbirth," the company belonging to my wife, Andrea.

## What is Redeemed Childbirth?
Redeemed Childbirth is the name of my wife's company where she primarily teaches birth and early childcare classes. She mostly works with a local birth center. Due to COVID retrictions enacted previously in Florida, her birth center asked her to develop an online option. Andrea was able to make a video series which proved a great option when in-person classes were not allowed, and still continues to serve as a last resort now, where even though restrictions are ended, there are still occasional emergencies or reasons people cannot attend in person.

Redeemed Childbirth got its name becuase of my wife's story. She had a difficult first birth in a hospital, but was able to have a redemptive experience at the birth center where she is now affiliated--the whole story will eventually be on the website. Long story short, she is now poassionate about sharing the knowledge she wishes she had for that first birth, and loves to share in the lives of soon-to-be mothers.

There are also many places where there may not be a birth center nearby at all, let alone one as developed as the one where our children have been born. In light of this, we are looking into developing an online course that may be available to anyone, and provide some side income as well.

## Implementation

|Goal/Milestone | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
|Postgres|Set up tables and logic|
|Django|Set up paths, connect database|
|Front end|Figure out details later|

## Back end
Using Django and postgres, my first goal is to set up the backend for the site. It will be capable of tracking client information.
