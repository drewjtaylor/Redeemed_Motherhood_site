# Redeemed Motherhood Website


## Goal
This repository has been set up as I learn to create a functioning website for "Redeemed Motherhood," the company belonging to my wife, Andrea.

## What is Redeemed Motherhood?
Redeemed Motherhood is the name of my wife's company where she teaches birth and early childcare classes. She mostly works with a local birth center. Due to COVID retrictions enacted previously in Florida, her birth center asked her to develop an online option. Andrea was able to make a video series which proved a great option when in-person classes were not allowed, and still continues to serve as a last resort now, where even though restrictions are ended, there are still occasional emergencies or reasons people cannot attend in person.

Redeemed Motherhood got its name becuase of my wife's story. She had a difficult first birth in a hospital, but was able to have a redemptive experience at the birth center where she is now affiliated--the whole story will eventually be on the website. Long story short, she is now passionate about sharing the knowledge she wishes she had for that first birth, and loves to share in the lives of soon-to-be mothers.

There are also many places where there may not be a birth center nearby at all, let alone one as developed as the one where our children have been born. In light of this, we are looking into developing an online course that may be available to anyone, and provide some side income as well.

## Implementation

|Goal/Milestone | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
|Postgres|Set up tables and logic|
|Django|Set up paths, connect database|
|Front end|Figure out details later|

## Back end
Using Django and postgres, my first goal is to set up the backend for the site. It will be capable of tracking client information.

### Features to keep in mind/add:
- Clients can create an account
- Clients can be given access to specific videos (automatically if they have purchased access)
- Videos that have been created can be linked to or downloaded 
- Invoices can be sent by owner to email address on file (and/or text)
- Invoices can be paid by clients

### Project status for Nucamp
As I will be taking the front-end courses later, I did not try to do much as far as a "paint-job" for the templates. The primary thing I wanted to work on was minor functionality in order to test successful deployment to AWS.

### Test
To test the current functionality, I used the built-in admin page to add information to the database for two of her videos already uploaded to you-tube.

Visiting "base_url/videos/index" where "base_url" is whatever domain AWS assigns should show a list of videos dynamically generated by a Django template using a for loop on all "Video" objects.

Then, clicking on a video in the list should link to base_url/videos/primary_key_for_clicked_video, and a basic display page will pop up with that video embedded.
